# Health App
This project is a Health App that helps users track their body records, exercise history, and maintain a health diary. The app provides visualizations of body weight and body fat percentage over different time intervals (day, week, month, year). It also includes features such as achievements, meal history, and a recommendation page with categorized recommendations related to health, beauty, and diet.

### Problem
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle requires monitoring and tracking various aspects of one's health. It can be challenging to keep track of body records, exercise routines, and meal history in a convenient and organized manner. Additionally, finding relevant recommendations for health, beauty, and diet can be time-consuming and overwhelming.

### Solution
The Health App provides a user-friendly interface to address the problem mentioned above. The key features of the app include:

- Body Record Visualization: Users can record their body weight and body fat percentage, and visualize the data in a graph format. The app offers multiple time intervals (day, week, month, year) for viewing the progress.

- Exercise History
Users can log their exercise routines, including exercise type, calories burned, and duration. This feature helps users track their physical activity and monitor their progress towards fitness goals.

- Health Diary
Users can maintain a health diary to record their thoughts, progress, and any other health-related information. This feature allows users to reflect on their journey, set goals, and track their overall well-being.

- My Record Page: Users can access a dedicated page to view and manage their body records, exercise history, and health diary.

- Homepage: The homepage provides an overview of the user's health progress. It includes an achievement rate to track goals, a body weight-body fat percentage graph for the last 12 months, and a meal history section.
